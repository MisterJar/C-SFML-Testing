# C-SFML-Testing

Hey! I am a 17 year old who wants to program in C++ and moderen C++.
I am learning the basics and I am using SFML 2.4 to make some small simple programs and games.

If you want to help me with C++, You can make changes and make comments inside the code to help me further with my C++ development skills.

Thank you very much!
